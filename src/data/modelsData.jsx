    description:
      " Photrek’s Risk Assessment Service provides a graphical and quantitative assessment of probabilistic forecasts. The user inputs a vector of probabilities forecasted for a set of events that actually occurred; i.e. the outcome of a test. The assessment consists of a histogram of the probabilities forecasted and an overlay of three metrics (Accuracy, Decisiveness, and Robustness).\n\nThe metrics derive from a generalization of information theory but are presented in the probability domain for improved understanding. The Accuracy metric is a translation of the log-likelihood or cross-entropy into the probability domain and is computed by geometric mean. The Robustness metric is sensitive to the worst performance of the algorithm and is measured by the -2/3rds power of the generalized mean. The Decisiveness metric approximates the classification performance of making a decision with the probabilities and is measured by the arithmetic mean. (test)",

The service converts the input midi file, extracting information about notes, pauses between them and the duration of each note and pause, and then synthesizes the singing voice using machine learning methods.\n\nFor convenience and to avoid errors, it is recommended to generate a song by phrases. Note that the notes in the midi must be consistent and belong to the same instrument. It means that the Midi file only has the notes to sing. You can only enter Chinese characters to generate Chinese singing. Use AP or SP tokens for pauses where you want to hear a pause while singing. Do not forget that the number of notes and pauses in the midi file should be equal to the number of all input characters including SP and AP tokens.\n\nExample of correct input: SP祝你生日快乐SP祝你生日快",
